# Project Name

**Author**: Julian Barker, Mathieu Roberts
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. This codebase will serve as the backend for our online bookshelf of future and favorite reads.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Credit and Collaborations

### Team Agreement

#### Logistical

What hours will you be available to communicate?

- 9am - 3pm PDT

What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

- Slack

How often will you take breaks?

- as needed, every hour

What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

- ask TAs for help, re-evaluate hours

#### Cooperative

Make a list of each person’s strengths.

- Julian - Complex code logic
- Mathieu - Adaptability

How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

- Both of our strengths will enable us to efficiently write and debug our code or shift our approach if something isn't working.

In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

- Julian - improve at design and UI/UX choices
- Mathieu - creativity

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

- We will both be looking at every line of code that gets written, and will not move on unless we both understand the code.

#### Conflict Resolution

What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

- Boot them out

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

- Bring the issue up with the other member and elevate to a TA/instructor if they are not receptive

How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

- We will take it slow and steady and make sure we understand the steps and the overall architecture before speeding through code.
