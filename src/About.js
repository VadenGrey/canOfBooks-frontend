        Mathieu Roberts - Hello my name is Mathieu Roberts. Previously my work consisted of being a mechanic in the Army, now I am a software Developer because ive always have been interested in computers, and coding seems to be the best field where I could learn more about them while utilizing them to build programs.

      Julian Barker - I'm a junior software engineer, tech enthusiast, and prior Army Officeer. I'm proficient in HTML, CS, and JS, as well as common frontend frameworks such as React and Bootstrap. One of my greatest strengths is my voracious appetite for learning new skills and tools. I'm looking for opportunities to contribute and hone my skills in a team of talented devs. I love a challenge, and I love seeing the positive impacts of the work I contribute!

      Mehtab Riar - Before I switched over to software development, I worked as a project manager and a researcher. The skills and tools I learned in project management and research are very transferable to software development, both of which require unique problem solving and a level of sociability. Software development is not necessarily a pivot away from those fields, rather it builds on top of them. Tech is prevalent in every aspect of our lives and it will continue to integrate itself into these professions to add functionality we didnâ€™t think was possible. I chose to transition into software development because I loved the creative problem solving aspect of it as there can be a multitude of solutions to the same problem and the social environment coding takes place in.
